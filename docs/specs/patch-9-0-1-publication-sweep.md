# Patch 9.0.1 publication sweep

Audit page 229972 revision 6471353 against current retail 12.1.0. Publication is not historical/native behavior parity.

## Requirements

- [x] Retain pinned source, recorded generator/extractor flags, every inventory/extract/caption occurrence.
- [x] Probe every inventory occurrence with integrated later registers and an exact reviewed gap fixture.
- [x] Retire only unused members with qualified/bare cached-Lua and whole simulator/test scans; preserve classic and deprecation wrappers.
- [x] Preserve earlier source bytes, extraction-mode outcomes and byte-identical register reproduction.
- [x] Verify all publication sweeps, one-ID negative control, affected bare/cached/Mists behavior, formatting, Mists warning boundary and startup `[]`.

## Exclusions

Historical client reconstruction, guessed constants/defaults, placeholder publication fixes, linked-page expansion, vendor/cache/Wowless edits, canonical/sibling writes, agents/models, push and merge.

## Retained boundaries

Exact gap identities and reasons live in the fixture and per-ID review; counts are derived, not a fixed compatibility contract. Substantive extract targets receive no behavior credit. At integration main thread prepends 9.0.2, then regenerates current observations, fixtures and coverage/evidence; placeholder excludes it on this branch.

## Current gap reconciliation — 2026-10-14

The saved `983f02fbf` default prefork sweep failed only on resolved/stale entries for `C_UIWidgetManager.GetDiscreteProgressStepsVisualizationInfo`; no new gap was reported. Reconcile the current known-gap fixture (262 → 261) with the already-modeled [discrete-progress contract](ui-widget-discrete-progress-steps.md). Source rows, IDs, later-register ordering and exact set equality remain unchanged. Historical reviewed captures/counts remain historical, not rewritten. This closes only obsolete missing-endpoint expectations; native/signature/payload parity is not inferred. Current-revision targeted execution remains pending.
