# ReloadUI

`C_UI.Reload` and legacy `ReloadUI` request a fresh Lua/UI environment after the invoking Lua call returns. The modeled request lives in `src/c_api/c_ui.rs`; environment retirement lives in `src/lua_api/` and is serviced by the environment owner. GUI and Lua IPC use the same operation. See [lifecycle mechanics](../wiki/systems/reload-ui.md).

## What it must do

- [x] Coalesce Lua reload requests without dispatching reload events or destroying Lua inside the invoking call.
- [x] Save declared account and character SavedVariables before retiring the old VM; read back table and scalar values during fresh addon loading. Do not apply the external import-size cap to just-written reload data or re-import stale WTF values over it. Keep `--no-saved-vars` disabled across reload and never write imported WTF files.
- [x] Discard old globals, frames, scripts, timers, animation state, templates and addon-loading state. Release the old Lua VM; rerun the real startup/addon-loading path with the original launch settings.
- [x] Preserve modeled server/session/player/world/party state and process IPC/texture/font resources. Clear GUI frame-ID, input and render caches before drawing the new UI.
- [x] Service reloads requested by Lua IPC, GUI shortcut, slash commands, events and timers only after the active Lua call unwinds; subsequent IPC commands use the new environment and retain print-output isolation.

### File-backed client state

- [x] Restore the file-backed EditMode cache using the initial layout name and config, without re-importing ServerSnapshot. The original EditMode consumer must select the same active layout after ReloadUI. Native reread timing/ordering is INFERRED and unasserted.

Wrath build 12340 chronology is authenticated by clean-room laptop reconstruction `0e4e9fe0`, independently checked at `228` (relayed 2026-10-19); this is static source evidence, not native execution. Retail engine chronology remains UNKNOWN. Existing simulator policy is documented in [event system](../event-system.md#startup-event-sequence); it is not proof of native Retail order.

### Wrath 12340 requirements

Verified 2026-10-19: among all seven active profile caches, only Wrath's shipped Lua calls bare `DisableAddOn` (`FrameXML/StaticPopup.lua:466`); Mists, Era, Anniversary, Forever, Retail and PTR call `C_AddOns.DisableAddOn`. Existing `register_legacy_addon_fns` is shared by every non-Retail/non-PTR profile. The added legacy registration is therefore Wrath-only and uses the exact `c_addons_disable_addon` backing function, not an alias table or workaround.

| Slice | Required boundary | Current proof |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A prerequisite | Original StaticPopup acceptance disables its selected addon, then requests reload | Exact fixture RED `1a20ccf65`; producer `2711a473e` GREEN through original popup and C_AddOns enable-state query |
| A | Deferred request waits outside cinematic playback; zero results, coalescing, no explicit combat rejection | Original-popup cinematic RED at `2711a473e`; GREEN 2/2 at `121e4fe47` |
| B | Temporary protected-action allowance and argless REGEN_ENABLED precede conditional LEAVING, then LOGOUT; handlers finish before addon SV serialization | Exact fixture `fa73666b1`: three feature-absence REDs, noncombat control passes; producer `439b8e806`, GREEN 4/4 compiled `51bd62586` |
| C | Per-addon code/bindings, account SV, character SV, then ADDON_LOADED(name), one argument | Wrath behavioral RED `06d7cbcee`, Retail payload RED `0a2e2fb3d`, and exact `f1f445ce5` scalar-clobber RED. Producer `437bca644`: Wrath 4/4 and Retail payload 1/1 GREEN at `35851e23f`; guarded-default nested/large/WTF control passes both before (`840385e82`, f1 production) and after the producer |
| D | Both account chunks ready: VARIABLES_LOADED inline before LOGIN/argless PEW; pending chunks may defer it past entry; no synthetic WoWUISim addon event | Exact `f1f445ce5` feature REDs; producer `24ba76443`, GREEN 4/4 at `159f9f36f`. Original ticked Stopwatch OnShow/OnHide outputs pass before (sealed `35851e23f` production with `159f9f36f` fixtures) and after D. GameMenu is blocked by early-bound missing-global fast handlers and the separate cursor gap; spellbook remains an uncounted diagnostic |
| E | Restore eligible named user-placed movable/resizable frames on new objects, excluding DontSavePosition; cancel mirror timers on LeaveWorld, retain totems/player context | Exact `f1f445ce5`: six feature REDs, disabled-persistence control PASS. Producer `f0937f6ac` plus readability `10023c3d9`: GREEN 8/8,20.84s, including inherited-scale roundtrip; disabled-persistence control passes both sides. Added scale fixture also fails missing-file on sealed pre-E `159f9f36f` production; numeric native parity is not asserted |

Managed Wrath loading executes addon code before each declared saved scope, once per file rather than once per variable. Account precedes character; persisted scalars and nonempty tables overwrite code defaults. Initial WTF import retains its size limit and priority; trusted reload reads simulator storage without reimporting WTF or applying that external limit. Other profiles retain their existing SV policy. Real-addon Retail startup and LoD notifications append a boolean derived from parsed named XML bindings, including conventional `Bindings.xml`; that value derivation is INFERRED, not native evidence.

Scope approval limits C to managed startup/direct-load SV ordering. C_AddOns runtime LoD persistence remains UNMODELED: `src/c_api/c_addons_runtime.rs:131,135` calls `load_addon_from_toc`, which passes no manager at `src/loader/mod.rs:492`; a new ownership seam is a separate follow-up. Slice E uses the independently verified 12340 placed-frame and file-format facts relayed 2026-10-19 from reconstruction `0e4e9fe0a4a9fa08027c5eed4b2c5e873739cfd3`. Original anchors and relative targets are NOT serialized. Save selects one corresponding frame/root point pair by minimum squared distance, with strict-first ties in TOPLEFT, TOP, TOPRIGHT, LEFT, CENTER, RIGHT, BOTTOMLEFT, BOTTOM, BOTTOMRIGHT order. Eligibility requires a named, user-placed, movable OR resizable frame, not DontSavePosition, with a queryable rect; visibility and relative-target name do not exclude it.

Load resolves the new frame by name. CURRENT movable frames replace points with the stored point against the SAME root point; CURRENT resizable frames receive stored size. Each applicable operation marks user-placed. Nonnegative levels are assigned subject to the native upward-delta cap of 128, followed by layout resolution. Load does not recheck DontSavePosition. Missing frames are skipped.

Native storage is character-local `layout-local.txt`, not Lua SV. The simulator uses the persistence manager's `storage_dir/<realm>/<character>/layout-local.txt`, creating directories normally only when a manager is present; disabled persistence writes nothing. Tests use temporary roots only. No test or producer may create/modify the real `~/.local/share/wow-sim` tree.

The exact writer grammar is `Version: 1\n`, then per frame `Frame`, `FrameLevel`, `Anchor`, `X`, `Y`, `W`, `H` lines, each `Key: value\n`, one space, signed decimal integers and uppercase point names; no separators and final LF. Ordinary writer-generated records are the scope, not oversized-name/truncation quirks. Reader keys are case-insensitive; CR/LF/CRLF delimit lines. Unknown keys and Version values are ignored. New Frame/EOF applies records; per-frame defaults are TOPLEFT, X/Y/W/H=0, level=-1. Invalid anchors retain the current point; signed numeric prefixes stop at the first non-digit. H deliberately resets with other fields instead of reproducing an unverified reconstruction carry-over quirk.

Documented simulator deviation: store its own unscaled layout units and round to nearest/ties-even. Divide displacement and resolved width/height by the frame's effective scale, including inherited parent scale; treat both axes identically. Scale itself is never saved or restored. Native uses width conversion for BOTH axes with lrintf; the DDCToNDCWidth/aspect factor A (F=1024*A) is unauthenticated and must not be guessed. Native rounding-mode parity is unmeasured. Files are round-trip equivalent in simulator units, with NO native numeric or byte parity for X/Y/W/H.

Wrath startup registers a pending account-variables callback. Ready chunks dispatch VARIABLES_LOADED inline; otherwise `set_account_cvar_chunk_ready` dispatches once when both chunks are ready, including after LOGIN/PEW. Reload retires the pending callback, not account readiness. This supplied completion seam does not model account networking. Wrath omits synthetic ADDON_LOADED("WoWUISim") and PEW has no arguments; other profiles retain their startup policy.

The request's unnamed taint gate/default/producer and feedback contract remain evidence-blocked. Do not invent them. SPELLS_CHANGED reload occurrence/order is UNKNOWN. General engine timer policy and full native shutdown persistence are not implemented by this bounded goal. Combat reentry notification is combat-bit conditional; its finer position among startup events is not asserted. The simulator ends the Wrath permission window in its world-entry helper after PEW; this placement is INFERRED simulator policy, not a new authenticated partial order. Combat state is never cleared to simulate this window. `InCombatLockdown` and the existing protected-frame state-change probe share the same permission predicate.

Pinned Retail API docs at `b9be9379719047977fca4dba1bb1d9988e8840b3` declare ADDON_LOADED(name STRING, containsBindings BOOL) and PEW(initialLogin BOOL, reloadingUi BOOL). Reload values and containsBindings value semantics beyond type are INFERRED. These declarations do not authenticate Retail chronology or other-profile payloads. The payload slice covers only real-addon startup and C_AddOns LoD emissions. Synthetic Retail ADDON_LOADED("WoWUISim") is deliberately unchanged and remains a separate non-native simulator-policy gap.

## How it works

- [Reload lifecycle](../wiki/systems/reload-ui.md)
- [Startup and dispatch](../wiki/systems/event-system.md#startup-event-sequence)
- [Addon loading](../addon-loading-pipeline.md)

## Implementation inventory

- `src/c_api/c_ui.rs` — modeled `C_UI.Reload`, also called by Blizzard’s public `ReloadUI` wrapper.
- `src/lua_api/globals/state_backed_queries.rs` — legacy Lua `ReloadUI` registration sharing the request producer.
- `src/lua_api/env.rs` — Lua VM construction and handle retirement.
- `src/bin/wow_sim/startup.rs` — real startup/addon-loading pipeline.
- `src/startup.rs` — startup event dispatch.
- `src/saved_variables.rs` — declared-variable persistence.
- `src/iced_app/update.rs` — GUI lifecycle owner and shortcut.
- `src/iced_app/update_servers.rs` — IPC execution boundary.
- `src/lua_server.rs` — persistent socket transport.
- `src/bin/wow_sim/main.rs`, `src/bin/wow_sim/gui_commands.rs`, `src/lua_errors.rs` — one-shot owner service before output.

## Tests asserting this spec

- `src/iced_app/app_tests.rs` — shortcut sentinel/frame/VM retirement and Lua-requested SavedVariables persistence.
- `src/lua_server/exec_tests.rs` — public Unix Exec request, reload, subsequent fresh environment and print output.
- `src/bin/wow_sim/main.rs`, `src/bin/wow_sim/gui_commands.rs` — dump/screenshot reload observation boundaries.
- `src/bin/wow_sim/startup.rs` — real `--no-addons` startup with declared Blizzard SavedVariables rebuilt through App.

## Final implementer gate — 2026-10-19

Production Rust is `10023c3d9`; final normal-code receipts compile `ce2a122ba` (docs-only delta). Test-only `3446189b6` isolates the Retail Settings payload fixture in a child process: real startup installs a process-global tracing subscriber once. The combined six-case batch reproduced a second-initialization panic before reload, then passed unchanged consumer assertions after isolation. Production logging was not altered. This module is gated by `test` and `profile-retail`, so the other proof scopes remain valid.

| Gate | Executed result |
| --- | --- |
| Wrath 12340 lifecycle | 23/23, no exclusions, full sound/gui/casc profile; C/D/E controls pass on both sides of their producers |
| Wrath shared owners/startup | Library 21/21; binary 3/5, with two unchanged, out-of-profile Console/EditMode fixtures failing before ReloadUI and explicitly classified non-blocking by the integrator |
| Retail preservation and payload | Library 21/21; binary 6/6 at `3446189b6`, including original Settings and non-default EditMode consumers |
| Compilation and format | Wrath/Retail GUI and headless checks: 4/4, zero warnings. Full format check passes at `3446189b6` |
| Stock startup | Wrath and Retail `--no-addons --no-saved-vars lua-errors` each emit exactly `[]` |

Receipts: `final-wrath-{check,headless-check,lib,runtime-abc2,runtime-de,bin-tests,startup}-receipt.json`, `final-retail-{check,headless-check,lib-reload,lib-startup,bin-tests2,startup}-receipt.json`, `final-fmt2-receipt.json`. Original persisted CVar hash/stat and directory listing remain unchanged; each runtime uses a copied current CVar file under child-only XDG storage. All builds/runs used capacity admission, the retained shared slot, 9-GiB single-job builds and 4-GiB/90-second runtimes.

The Wrath test build has one pre-existing `simple_html_tests.rs:2` unused import, byte-identical to the lane base and fixed separately by `65afa9064`; normal checks have none. No warning suppression or ignored tests were added. Full suites and native execution were not run. Independent integrated verification remains the next owner gate.

## Known gaps (current cycle)

- [ ] Independent integrated verification of these bounded Wrath/retail gates remains pending. Retail/other-profile native teardown ordering and target/focus preservation remain unconfirmed.
- [ ] Keyboard/mouse model-state preservation is INFERRED and unasserted pending native lifecycle evidence. Keep `mouse_position`, `mouse_buttons` and `pressed_keys`; discard frame-ID input caches, not these model values.
- [ ] Full Ellesmere acceptance and standalone `wow-cli` executable reruns remain separate from the bounded Unix-socket client proof.

### Bounded retail proof — 2026-10-19

69 logical cases pass, zero ignored: 64 library/App/socket/persistence cases at `e23196863` and five binary owner/startup cases at `79f52bb3f`. Only binary startup code and docs changed between these source points; the library proof remains valid. The EditMode case's isolated child is the same logical case, not an additional one.

Historical RED: four original freshness assertions on `f254e22ee`; dump/screenshot owner assertions on `6987f6145`; scalar/import-cap assertion on `5703ecc56`; original EditMode consumer assertion on `00f8dc298`. Private RED receipts: `red-{lib,startup}-receipt.json`, `owner-red-{lib,startup}-receipt.json`, `persistence-red2-lib-receipt.json`, `editmode-red-startup-receipt.json`. Current GREEN receipts: `input-green-lib-receipt.json` and `editmode-green-startup-receipt.json`.

| Capability | Behavioral evidence | Limit |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Deferred request and IPC isolation | Invoking chunk returns; already-queued Exec and real subsequent socket connection see fresh globals; print capture stays isolated | Acknowledgement is not startup-completion notification |
| VM/UI retirement | Old VM weak handle expires; old globals/frames/timer callbacks disappear; timer-originated request rebuilds | Native teardown sequence unconfirmed |
| Persistence | Declared Blizzard table survives real addon re-registration; account/character scalars and larger local tables survive; stale WTF does not win or change | External import cap remains intact |
| Startup/output owners | Real cached Blizzard startup loads twice; original EditMode consumer retains the non-default file-backed layout; dump, screenshot preparation and lua-errors observe fresh environment | Native cache-reread timing/order inferred; no full-addon acceptance claim |
| Preservation | Existing yielded startup/texture tests pass; modeled level, zone, party count and font/texture allocations survive | No native session-parity claim |

Both GREEN runtimes use child-only XDG directories with copied current CVars; original CVar hash/stat remain unchanged. `cargo fmt --check` passes. Full-default retail `cargo check -j1` passes with zero warnings at `f5f124f93` (same Rust as `79f52bb3f`), including `wow-sim`, `wow-cli`, library and auxiliary binaries. Default features: `sound`, `gui`, `casc`, `client-retail`. Private proof: `final-check-proof.json`.

## Out of scope

- Ellesmere runner or addon changes: the observed failure is simulator lifecycle state.
- Restarting the process, IPC server or modeled game session: only the UI/Lua environment reloads.
- Unconfirmed target/focus/native session-preservation claims: retain current model state without asserting native equivalence.
