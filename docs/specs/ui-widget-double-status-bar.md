# UI Widget DoubleStatusBar

Draft owning contract for `C_UIWidgetManager.GetDoubleStatusBarWidgetVisualizationInfo` and its actual cached `UIWidgetTemplateDoubleStatusBar` consumer. Existing supplied-set state/feed lives in `src/c_api/ui_widget_manager/`; earlier inspection at `2c843ad2c45fae07d3098a7fb39eacbde85c770d` conflated missing modeled backing with an absent runtime getter. First retail execution passed callable absent-record getters and safe provider skipping as existing behavior; populated Retail records and cached lifecycle now have bounded first-GREEN proof; bounded Retail/PTR security and lifecycle evidence independently passes. See [manager architecture](../wiki/systems/ui-widget-manager-state.md).

## What it must do

### Initial absent-record boundary

- [x] Publish the exact getter as a callable function. For a numeric ID with no supplied visualization, return exactly one nil result (not zero results, a placeholder table, or extra values).
- [x] With the actual profile-cached provider registered for visualization type 3, a normal supplied set containing that type and no visualization record must register through `UIWidgetContainerTemplate:RegisterForWidgetSet` without errors or acquiring a widget frame.
- [x] Replacing that supplied set through the normal host feed must preserve membership and safely reconcile without acquiring a frame or recording Lua errors.

### Documented record frontier (not covered by the initial tests)

Retail and PTR cached `Blizzard_APIDocumentationGenerated/UIWidgetManagerDocumentation.lua` name `DoubleStatusBarWidgetVisualizationInfo` as the getter's single nilable result and `widgetID` as a required number. The following **26 fields**, each non-nilable in those generated docs, define the grounded future full-record frontier; no default values or numeric enum policies are inferred. Secret argument metadata is `AllowedWhenUntainted`; bounded host-secret scope is independently accepted below. Native parity remains unproved.

| Field | Generated API type |
|---|---|
| `shownState` | `WidgetShownState` |
| `leftBarMin` | `number` |
| `leftBarMax` | `number` |
| `leftBarValue` | `number` |
| `leftBarTooltip` | `string` |
| `rightBarMin` | `number` |
| `rightBarMax` | `number` |
| `rightBarValue` | `number` |
| `rightBarTooltip` | `string` |
| `barValueTextType` | `StatusBarValueTextType` |
| `text` | `string` |
| `leftBarTooltipLoc` | `UIWidgetTooltipLocation` |
| `rightBarTooltipLoc` | `UIWidgetTooltipLocation` |
| `fillMotionType` | `UIWidgetMotionType` |
| `widgetSizeSetting` | `number` |
| `textureKit` | `textureKit` |
| `frameTextureKit` | `textureKit` |
| `hasTimer` | `bool` |
| `orderIndex` | `number` |
| `widgetTag` | `string` |
| `inAnimType` | `WidgetAnimationType` |
| `outAnimType` | `WidgetAnimationType` |
| `widgetScale` | `UIWidgetScale` |
| `layoutDirection` | `UIWidgetLayoutDirection` |
| `modelSceneLayer` | `UIWidgetModelSceneLayer` |
| `scriptedAnimationEffectID` | `number` |

Scaffolds `2b13a7c57` and `bd48d6ce8` add explicit 26-field `DoubleStatusBarRecord`, an initially empty environment-local keyed map and type3 typed host-feed storage. Those scaffold revisions did not add projection or modeled registration. `8645aaf0a` adds the complete 26-field fresh snapshot projection; `a62c81768` wires its module and registration. Selectors use shared `read_numeric_id` policy; no new validation, defaults, inferred records or demo seeds. Bounded Retail producer and cached lifecycle PASS at `a62c81768`; bounded Retail/PTR security scope at `a68dcda54` independently passes.

## How it works

- [UI widget manager state](../wiki/systems/ui-widget-manager-state.md)
- [Addon loading pipeline](../addon-loading-pipeline.md)
- [Event dispatch](../event-system.md)

## Implementation inventory

Source inspection: `src/lua_api/env_init/runtime_surface_bootstrap.lua:64–79` defines a generic namespace `__index` that logs missing keys, creates a function returning nil and caches it with `rawset`; lines112–129 attach that namespace metatable. That historical inspection predates modeled registration at `a62c81768`; `double_status_bar.rs` now supplies the producer. Callable absent-ID behavior therefore does not establish a modeled getter or native API availability.

- `src/c_api/ui_widget_manager/inputs.rs` — existing `WidgetSetEntry` and `WidgetSetRecord`, independent supplied membership.
- `src/c_api/ui_widget_manager/feed.rs` — existing `replace_ui_widget_set` publishes normal full reconciliation after storing membership.
- `src/c_api/ui_widget_manager/queries.rs` — existing set queries; missing modeled backing does not imply an absent runtime getter. Initial retail execution proves callable absent-record behavior only.
- Profile cache `Blizzard_UIWidgets/Blizzard_UIWidgetTemplateDoubleStatusBar.lua` — actual provider calls the exact getter and filters missing/hidden records; not repo-owned code.
- Profile cache `Blizzard_UIWidgets/Blizzard_UIWidgetManager.lua` — actual container registration, provider dispatch and frame acquisition.

## Tests asserting this spec

`tests/ui_widget_double_status_bar.rs`:

- `double_status_bar_getter_is_callable_and_absent_id_returns_exactly_one_nil` — exact callable getter and result count/value.
- `cached_double_status_bar_consumer_skips_member_without_visualization` — real closure, nonempty membership/provider guards, actual registration and ordinary host-feed reconciliation, zero acquisition/errors.

First retail execution on 2026-10-14 passed both tests for this model: **4 primary PASS across both models**, zero failures. Nested timeout-harness repeats are nonadditive. Callability, exactly one nil for absent records and safe cached-provider skipping passed as existing behavior on first execution. No genuine RED was observed, despite the artifact directory name.

Private saved-outcome verification (`widget-two-api-initial-outcome-current`), source `758dfdf5d8c49a1ca8d49fa518c01c7da9e65a1a`. It confirms four distinct Retail PASS, no genuine RED, and no populated-record coverage; timeout child summaries are not additional cases. This is bounded saved-evidence verification, not broad acceptance.

Current authored revision `fb7a1c243` contains twelve cases across both modules (six each): the two initial cases per module plus complete fresh/replaced snapshots, environment isolation, ordinary numeric selector policy and actual cached populated feed lifecycle. Genuine observed Retail RED at `fb7a1c24370fca440a68709e0a70b5a0e9c428f8`: 12 primary outcomes, **4 PASS / 8 FAIL**. Supplied queries return nil, missing-selector acceptance fails rejection expectations, and cached consumers acquire no populated widget; later lifecycle assertions are unreached. Private saved receipt `runtime-two-widget-populated-red`; independent classification confirms this bounded genuine RED. Bounded saved first GREEN at `a62c81768` (`widget-two-retail-first-green-current`) independently confirms **15 primary PASS: twelve two-widget cases plus three existing lifecycle controls**. Complete supplied snapshots, isolation, selectors and actual cached activation/update/hide/restore/removal/unregister pass. Requested owning sweep used the wrong integration target: zero executed cases, zero coverage credit.

Independent final receipts `widget-two-retail-final-runtime-current` and `widget-two-ptr-final-runtime-current` accept saved `a68dcda54` runtime: **17 primary PASS per profile: fourteen two-widget cases (including two actual host-secret selector cases) plus three old lifecycle controls**. Nested child summaries are nonadditive. Complete 26/19-field fresh snapshots, retained replacement snapshots, environment-local maps, shared required-number selectors and actual cached activation/update/hidden restore/removal/unregister pass. Actual present/absent host-secret wrappers survive untainted queries; tainted callers are denied before lookup and cannot declassify, public selectors remain usable, secure recovery and unchanged state pass. This is simulator security behavior, not native policy parity.

Retail additionally passes one separate owning `prefork_full_ui` sweep; three auxiliary zero-case summaries add no coverage. No fresh PTR owning sweep is claimed. Normal CLI stdout is `[]` per profile, with complete stderr retained: Retail291 addons/1569 cache hits; PTR283/1568. These bounded disabled-sound/addon/SavedVariables/CASC probes retain font fallback, read-only EditMode cache and post-load workaround restoration; zero reported Lua errors is not globally clean startup. Retail normal CLI reuses the unchanged-production `a62c81768` executable, not an a68 rebuild.

`widget-two-final-check-current` records format/default check exit0, zero compiler-message records, six manifest deprecation warnings and package/build lock waits. Initial admission at memory pressure5.50 launched zero workloads; PTR original receipt-schema setup failures also launched zero workloads. Corrected saved gates do not overwrite those failures. Shared registration does not prove native or earlier-profile availability; all-seven/runtime/render/native/full-parent closure remains unproved. Current broad suite at `4fc115b93` was submitted asynchronously; submission is not a result. Historical983 FAIL remains unchanged.

## Known gaps (current cycle)

- [x] Execute both initial retail boundaries and preserve the PASS artifact above; no genuine RED observed.
- [x] Independent saved-outcome report confirms initial four PASS only.
- [x] Observe genuine populated Retail RED: four primary PASS / eight FAIL; independent saved-evidence classification PASS.
- [x] Implement complete modeled getter projection/registration at `8645aaf0a` + `a62c81768`.
- [x] Independently verify bounded Retail producer12 and full cached activation/update/hide/restore/removal/unregister at `a62c81768`.
- [x] Independently accept Retail/PTR security2 within each17-case runtime gate and separate Retail owning-sweep1; no PTR owning sweep credit.
- [ ] Establish other-profile/native/render/full-parent acceptance; bounded PTR runtime and final default check are accepted, not broad closure.

## Out of scope

- Inferred catalog/default records and vendor behavior replacement are not part of the supplied-state contract.
- These initial boundaries do not prove native parity, rendered fidelity, other-profile behavior, or broader parent acceptance; those remain separate evidence gaps.
