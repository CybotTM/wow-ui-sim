# Adventure Guide Layout

Adventure Guide Suggested Content cards can overlap text and buttons when runtime geometry queries resolve a resized frame without also resolving frames anchored to it.

## Content

Blizzard's `EJSuggestFrame_RefreshDisplay` resizes the title and description frames, then immediately reads `GetTop()` and `GetBottom()` to recenter each card's `centerDisplay`. The secondary cards chain their layout through anchors:

- `title`
- `description`, anchored to `title:BOTTOMLEFT`
- `button`, anchored to `description:BOTTOMLEFT`

The simulator's synchronous dirty-rect fast path resolved only the queried frame when Lua called geometry methods such as `GetBottom()`. If `title:SetHeight()` made the title dirty, `title:GetBottom()` returned the new title rect, but dependent siblings like `description` still kept their old cached rects. That made Adventure Guide text and buttons overlap even though the Blizzard XML anchors were correct.

The fix is for `SimState::resolve_rect_if_dirty` to use the anchor-dependent layout path for directly dirty frames, and for dirty ancestor resolution to recompute anchor dependents before clearing dirty roots. The hit-grid incremental queue must include those same transitive anchor dependents, because moved sibling buttons are not descendants of the resized anchor target. Regression coverage lives in `tests/layout_resolve.rs` as `querying_resized_anchor_target_updates_dependent_siblings`.

Follow-up: the cards could still overlap after the stale-rect fix because `GetNumLines` was registered by the tooltip widget methods after the general text methods on the shared FrameRef metatable. Non-tooltip FontStrings therefore called the tooltip line counter and returned `0`, so Blizzard sized title/description containers to zero lines. `GameTooltip` keeps tooltip-backed line counting, while regular FontStrings now compute line count from measured wrapped text height. Regression coverage lives in `tests/fontstring_anchor_pinned_width.rs` as `fontstring_get_num_lines_reports_wrapped_line_count`.

Follow-up: the card portraits had two separate source issues. Blizzard calls `Texture:SetMask("Interface\\CharacterFrame\\TempPortraitAlphaMask")` for the circular card portraits, but the simulator's `SetMask` method was still a no-op, so icons rendered square instead of clipping to the gold circle. The seeded `C_AdventureJournal` suggestions also used two missing texture paths (`Achievement_Raid_Nerubian` and `Inv_Archaeology_70_Scroll`), which left the Nerub-ar Palace and Delves portraits blank. `SetMask` now creates a real mask texture wired through the existing mask renderer, and the seed icons use manifest-backed 64x64 paths.
