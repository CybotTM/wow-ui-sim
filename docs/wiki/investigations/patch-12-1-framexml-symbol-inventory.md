# Patch 12.1 FrameXML Symbol Inventory

Exhaustive human-readable status inventory for the local 12.1 FrameXML API snapshot. The machine SSOT is `data/patch-api/12.1-framexml.json`; its generated compact checklist is `docs/generated/patch-12-1-framexml-checklist.md`. This page prevents the broad 12.1 audit from silently treating parsed global APIs as the whole source scope.

## Content

**Scope:** 320 added entries and 112 removed entries from `/tmp/warcraft_12_1_framexml.json` (432 entries total). `MacroFrame_SaveMacro` and `PlayerChoiceToggle_TryShow` occur in both source lists, so the snapshot represents 430 distinct names.

**Status rule:** Each entry is classified independently. `implemented` and `best-effort` rows name their modeled behavior and focused coverage. `untriaged` is neutral draft state, not an exception request. Only individually proven unsafe/impossible rows may become `exception-requested`. Vendor presence alone is not focused behavioral coverage.

**Current totals:** 1 implemented, 431 best-effort, 0 exception-requested, 0 untriaged.

| `HideBarberShopFrame` | best-effort | Stale snapshot addition: bare token is absent from the complete PTR source corpus, and full explicit addon loading leaves the symbol nil. |
| `HideBlackMarketFrame` | best-effort | Classified as reversed-name snapshot mismatch: PTR defines `BlackMarketFrame_Hide` with panel-hide and close-sound behavior, not `HideBlackMarketFrame`; focused PTR test explicitly loads `Blizzard_BlackMarketUI`, verifies the authoritative helper, and confirms the reversed wrapper remains absent. |

| `HideItemUpgradeFrame` | best-effort | Classified as reversed-name snapshot mismatch: PTR defines and uses `ItemUpgradeFrame_Hide`, not `HideItemUpgradeFrame`; focused PTR test explicitly loads `Blizzard_ItemUpgradeUI` and verifies the reversed wrapper remains absent. |
| `HideProfessionsCustomerOrdersFrame` | best-effort | Classified as snapshot/runtime mismatch: recursive local PTR source scan finds no definition; focused PTR test loads the required ProfessionsTemplates/AuctionHouse dependencies plus `Blizzard_ProfessionsCustomerOrders`, verifies the frame exists, and confirms the wrapper remains absent. |
