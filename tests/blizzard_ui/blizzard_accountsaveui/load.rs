//! Load smoke for `Blizzard_AccountSaveUI`.
//!
//! TOC reference (`Interface/BlizzardUI/Blizzard_AccountSaveUI/
//! Blizzard_AccountSaveUI.toc`):
//!
//! ```text
//! ## Title: Blizzard_AccountSaveUI
//! ## LoadOnDemand: 1
//! ## AllowLoad: Glue
//! ## Dependencies: Blizzard_GlueXML
//! ```
//!
//! Two assertions are pinned here:
//!
//! 1. Loading the smoke-shape closure rooted at this addon completes
//!    cleanly with zero lane-specific Lua errors recorded — the addon's
//!    file-scope code (`Blizzard_AccountSaveUI.lua`,
//!    `Blizzard_AccountSaveUI.xml`) must not throw against the current
//!    SimState. The lane filter watches for the addon's own name plus
//!    every global it publishes (`AccountSaveFrameMixin`, the two
//!    `StaticPopupDialogs[ACCOUNT_SAVE_*]` keys, and the
//!    `ACCOUNT_SAVE_KICK_ERROR_CODE` constant).
//!
//! 2. The TOC's sole `## Dependencies: Blizzard_GlueXML` entry appears in
//!    the loaded-addon list after the smoke-shape harness runs. The closure
//!    walker pulls Blizzard_GlueXML's own deps transitively (the glue
//!    foundation set — Blizzard_StaticPopup_Glue, Blizzard_GlueMenuFrame,
//!    Blizzard_HelpPlate, …), so pinning Blizzard_GlueXML directly is the
//!    smallest assertion that survives any future closure-walker behavior
//!    change.
//!
//! The TOC's `## AllowLoad: Glue` line forces the harness onto the
//! glue/CharacterSelect screen — the standard `with_blizzard_addon_smoke_shape`
//! helper hardcodes `ScreenKind::Game`, which would silently filter this
//! addon out of the discovery pool (`TocFile::allows_screen(Game)` is
//! false for `## AllowLoad: Glue`). The dedicated
//! `with_blizzard_addon_glue_smoke_shape` helper pins
//! `ScreenKind::CharacterSelect`.
//!
//! The known `ACCOUNT_SAVE_RESULT` event-registration gap noted in PLAN.md
//! does not surface here: `RegisterEvent("ACCOUNT_SAVE_RESULT")` runs only
//! from `AccountSaveFrameMixin:OnLoad`, which fires on the
//! `<Frame mixin="AccountSaveFrameMixin">` instance during XML parsing.
//! That call is no-op routed through the simulator's event-name registry —
//! it does not require the event to be a known constant in the simulator's
//! event-dispatch table, so the load path is clean even though
//! `ACCOUNT_SAVE_RESULT` is not yet a recognised Lua surface event.
