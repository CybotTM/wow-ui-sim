//! Load smoke for `Blizzard_AccountStore`.
//!
//! TOC reference (`Interface/BlizzardUI/Blizzard_AccountStore/
//! Blizzard_AccountStore.toc`):
//!
//! ```text
//! ## Title: Blizzard Account Store
//! ## AllowLoad: Both
//! ## Dependencies: Blizzard_SharedXML, Blizzard_StaticPopup
//! ## OptionalDep: Blizzard_UIParentPanelManager
//! ## LoadOnDemand: 1
//! ```
//!
//! Why this lane uses the game-shape `with_blizzard_addon_smoke_shape`
//! harness rather than the glue counterpart: `## AllowLoad: Both` keeps
//! the addon visible to both screen pools, and `Blizzard_UIParentPanelManager`
//! (the panel-management dep that AccountStore registers itself with via
//! `RegisterUIPanel`) only ships in the game lane. The smoke-shape harness's
//! `load_panel_addons` baseline pre-loads `Blizzard_UIParentPanelManager`
//! before the closure walker runs (`tests/common/panel_fixtures.rs:53-56`),
//! so the addon's `RegisterUIPanel` / `UIPanelWindows` calls land against a
//! fully initialized panel manager — without that baseline the lane would
//! emit nil-call errors at file scope.
//!
//! The TOC parser recognizes both `## OptionalDep:` and `## OptionalDeps:`, so
//! the closure-walked `loaded` set should contain `Blizzard_UIParentPanelManager`
//! directly. The panel-addons baseline still pre-loads it for the smoke-shape
//! harness, but the dependency closure is now the source of truth for this lane.
//!
//! Assertion pinned: loading the smoke-shape closure rooted at
//! `Blizzard_AccountStore` completes cleanly with zero lane-specific Lua
//! errors recorded. The lane's six file-scope Lua chunks
//! (`Blizzard_AccountStoreUtil.lua`, `Blizzard_AccountStoreCategoryList.lua`,
//! `Blizzard_AccountStoreCardTemplates.lua`, `Blizzard_AccountStoreItemRack.lua`,
//! `Blizzard_AccountStoreItemDisplay.lua`, `Blizzard_AccountStore.lua`) plus
//! their XML siblings register every `AccountStore*Mixin` /
//! `Fullscreen*AccountStore*Mixin` global at file scope; any nil-call,
//! missing global, or template-resolution failure would be recorded into
//! `state.lua_errors` and surface in the filtered list below.
