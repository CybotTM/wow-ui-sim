//! Mixin-method surface pin for `FullscreenAccountStoreContainerMixin`
//! (toplevel container hosting AccountStoreFrame in WoW Labs / Plunderstorm).
//!
//! Spec/source mismatch finding (PLAN.md task for
//! `FullscreenAccountStoreContainerMixin`): the plan names four
//! methods — `OnLoad`, `OnShow`, `OnHide`, `OnKeyDown` (escape-key
//! handling) — but `Blizzard_AccountStore.lua:66-100` declares only
//! three methods on the mixin. Three of the four PLAN names match
//! the source verbatim; one (`OnLoad`) is absent — the mixin has no
//! init lifecycle method at all. The container needs no `OnLoad`
//! wiring because the keyboard input it consumes is enabled via the
//! XML attribute `enableKeyboard="true"` on the frame declaration
//! (`Blizzard_AccountStore.xml:149`), so `OnKeyDown` fires without
//! any Lua-side `RegisterEvent` / handler-wiring step. The container
//! is also `toplevel="true" hidden="true"` and is reparented into
//! visibility by `AccountStoreMixin:SetFullscreenMode`
//! (`Blizzard_AccountStore.lua:50`), not by an OnLoad initializer:
//!
//! | PLAN name        | Status                                                     |
//! |------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
//! | `OnLoad`         | absent — no method by this name on `FullscreenAccountStoreContainerMixin`. The mixin has no init lifecycle. Keyboard input is XML-enabled (`enableKeyboard="true"` on the frame at `Blizzard_AccountStore.xml:149`), and the container's visibility lifecycle is driven externally by `AccountStoreMixin:SetFullscreenMode` (which reparents AccountStoreFrame between UIParent and FullscreenAccountStoreContainer + toggles container `Show()` / `Hide()`). PLAN's `OnLoad` has no closest-name analogue on the mixin. |
//! | `OnShow`         | present (`Blizzard_AccountStore.lua:68`)                   |
//! | `OnHide`         | present (`Blizzard_AccountStore.lua:82`)                   |
//! | `OnKeyDown`      | present (`Blizzard_AccountStore.lua:95`) — matches the PLAN parenthetical note "(escape-key handling)": the body checks `key == "ESCAPE"` and calls `LeaveFullscreenMode()`. |
//!
//! No PLAN-omitted-but-present methods — the mixin's complete
//! source surface is exactly the three PLAN-named-and-present
//! methods (`OnShow`, `OnHide`, `OnKeyDown`).
