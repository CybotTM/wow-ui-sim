//! Event registration surface for the `Blizzard_AchievementUI` lane.
//!
//! PLAN.md task: pin that `AchievementFrameAchievements` registers
//! `ADDON_LOADED`, `CRITERIA_UPDATE`, `ACHIEVEMENT_EARNED` after OnLoad.
//!
//! **Spec/source mismatch on the Mainline branch.** The PLAN claim mirrors
//! the **Cata** behavior (`Cata/Blizzard_AchievementUI.lua:525-530`), where
//! `_OnEvent` defers the heavy registration until `ADDON_LOADED` fires:
//!
//! ```lua
//! function AchievementFrameAchievements_OnEvent (self, event, ...)
//!     if ( event == "ADDON_LOADED" ) then
//!         self:RegisterEvent("ACHIEVEMENT_EARNED");
//!         self:RegisterEvent("CRITERIA_UPDATE");
//!         self:RegisterEvent("TRACKED_ACHIEVEMENT_LIST_CHANGED");
//!         self:RegisterEvent("RECEIVED_ACHIEVEMENT_MEMBER_LIST");
//!         ...
//! ```
//!
//! On Mainline (`Mainline/Blizzard_AchievementUI.lua:843-884`), `_OnLoad`
//! registers only `ADDON_LOADED`:
//!
//! ```lua
//! function AchievementFrameAchievements_OnLoad (self)
//!     self:RegisterEvent("ADDON_LOADED");
//!     -- (then: scrollbox view setup, no further RegisterEvent calls)
//! end
//! ```
//!
//! And `_OnEvent` (`Blizzard_AchievementUI.lua:925-954`) HANDLES the
//! `ACHIEVEMENT_EARNED` and `CRITERIA_UPDATE` branches in its `if/elseif`
//! ladder — but the ADDON_LOADED arm at lines 929-930 only calls
//! `AchievementFrameAchievements_UpdateTrackedAchievements()`, with no
//! further `self:RegisterEvent(...)` calls. The dispatch arms for
//! ACHIEVEMENT_EARNED, CRITERIA_UPDATE, RECEIVED_ACHIEVEMENT_MEMBER_LIST,
//! and ACHIEVEMENT_SEARCH_UPDATED never fire on this frame because the
//! events were never subscribed; the live registrations for those events
//! happen on **other** frames (`AchievementFrameSummary` registers
//! `ACHIEVEMENT_EARNED` at `Blizzard_AchievementUI.xml:2074` via inline
//! OnLoad, `AchievementFrameStats` registers `CRITERIA_UPDATE` on OnShow
//! at `Blizzard_AchievementUI.lua:2233`, etc.).
//!
//! Test split presence/absence so a regression in either direction fails
//! loudly with a meaningful message:
//!
//! - **Presence half** pins what OnLoad actually does — frame exists,
//!   `ADDON_LOADED` is registered, the OnEvent script is wired, and the
//!   `_OnEvent` global function exists and is reachable as the handler.
//!
//! - **Absence half** pins the spec-named-but-unregistered events as
//!   tripwires. A `true` reading on either would prove Blizzard restored
//!   the Cata-style deferred registration pattern (or moved the
//!   registrations into OnLoad), at which point the spec needs updating
//!   AND the OnEvent dispatch arms become live for the first time on
//!   this frame.
