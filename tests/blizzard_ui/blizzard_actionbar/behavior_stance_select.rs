//! Behavior pin: `StanceBar:Select(2)` fans through `CastShapeshiftForm(2)`,
//! which marks form #2 active in sim state and fires `UPDATE_SHAPESHIFT_FORM`.
//! `Blizzard_ActionBarController` observes that event and calls
//! `StanceBar:Update()`, which routes through `UpdateState` and flips the
//! checked state of `StanceButton2`. The whole round trip is synchronous.
//!
//! Source contract (`Interface/BlizzardUI/Blizzard_ActionBar/`,
//! `Interface/BlizzardUI/Blizzard_ActionBarController/`):
//!
//! 1. `StanceBarMixin:Select(id)`
//!    (`Blizzard_ActionBar/Shared/StanceBar.lua:102-105`) writes
//!    `self.lastSelected = id` and calls `CastShapeshiftForm(id)`. There is
//!    no gate, no event-loop bounce — this is a straight function call. So
//!    after `StanceBar:Select(2)` returns, the simulator has had a chance to
//!    react to whatever `CastShapeshiftForm` does.
//!
//! 2. `CastShapeshiftForm(index)`
//!    (`src/lua_api/globals/shapeshift.rs:101-125`) is a Rust global. It
//!    clears `is_active` on every entry of `state.shapeshift_forms`, toggles
//!    the indexed form (so the second `CastShapeshiftForm(2)` after a first
//!    would deselect it), and fires `UPDATE_SHAPESHIFT_FORM` synchronously
//!    via `fire_named_event_state`. Out-of-range indexes silently no-op.
//!
//! 3. `ActionBarController_OnLoad` registers `UPDATE_SHAPESHIFT_FORM` along
//!    with `UPDATE_SHAPESHIFT_FORMS` and `UPDATE_SHAPESHIFT_USABLE`
//!    (`Blizzard_ActionBarController/ActionBarController.lua:27-29`).
//!    `ActionBarController_OnEvent` lua:78-82 dispatches all three to
//!    `StanceBar:Update()`. The controller frame is created in
//!    `ActionBarController.xml:3-8` parented to UIParent, so it picks up
//!    events as soon as the addon loads.
//!
//! 4. `StanceBarMixin:Update()`
//!    (`Blizzard_ActionBar/Shared/StanceBar.lua:27-44`) reads
//!    `GetNumShapeshiftForms()` into `self.numForms`, and when `numForms > 0`
//!    calls `self:UpdateBackgroundArt()` then `self:UpdateState()`. The
//!    `numForms > 0` gate is what makes the form-state pre-population step
//!    in this test load-bearing: with the cold-start empty
//!    `state.shapeshift_forms`, `Update` would early-out at lua:34 and never
//!    reach `UpdateState`.
//!
//! 5. `StanceBarMixin:UpdateState()` (lua:58-100) iterates
//!    `self.actionButtons` (the table populated by `ActionBar_OnLoad` —
//!    `ActionBar.lua:13-44` creates `numButtons = 10` `<KeyValue>` per
//!    `Mainline/StanceBar.xml:23` buttons named `StanceButton1`..`StanceButton10`
//!    via the explicit `if self == StanceBar then buttonName = "StanceButton"..i`
//!    branch at `ActionBar.lua:21-22`). For each `i <= numForms` it calls
//!    `GetShapeshiftFormInfo(i)` → `(texture, isActive, isCastable, spellID)`,
//!    and at lua:80-85 dispatches `button:SetChecked(isActive)`. Because
//!    `CastShapeshiftForm` cleared every other form before activating the
//!    target, exactly one button transitions to checked per Select call —
//!    and `StanceBar.lastSelected` already equals that index because the
//!    Select method wrote it before calling Cast.
//!
//! Why the test sets up two forms (Bear=spell 5487, Cat=spell 768) instead
//! of just one: the round-trip pin needs the *transition* to be observable,
//! so we need a button that goes from unchecked → checked in response to
//! Select(2). With one form, Select(1) would be ambiguous between "the
//! checked transition fired" and "the cold state is already checked because
//! form 1 was the only candidate". The two-form fixture forces the bar to
//! choose, and the test asserts both that #2 became checked and that #1
//! stayed unchecked — pinning the cross-button isolation.
//!
//! Why the test calls `StanceBar:Update()` after populating sim state but
//! before the Select call: the simulator seeds Paladin aura forms by default,
//! while this test needs a two-form Bear/Cat fixture for a precise transition.
//! Re-running Update after overwriting the state sets `self.numForms = 2` and
//! dispatches the first `UpdateState` call — at this point both buttons read
//! `isActive = false` so both are unchecked. That gives a clean cold state for
//! the Select(2) round trip.
//!
//! Why the test pre-populates state via the Rust `state().borrow_mut()`
//! seam rather than firing some Lua event: there is no sim-side Lua API for
//! "register a stance form" — `state.shapeshift_forms` is the canonical
//! source, written only by Rust (the simulator's class/spec/level system,
//! or test fixtures). `tests/c_shapeshift_globals.rs:14-32` uses the same
//! Bear+Cat fixture for the unit-level cast tests; this behavior test
//! reuses the data shape so the same form indexes match.
//!
//! The test pins the following observations:
//!   1. **`StanceBar` global exists and `StanceButton1`/`StanceButton2`
//!      globals exist after harness settle.** These are the
//!      `<Frame name="StanceBar">` element from `Mainline/StanceBar.xml:12`
//!      and the buttons created by `ActionBar_OnLoad` lua:31. A nil reading
//!      means the XML didn't load or the `if self == StanceBar` branch at
//!      `ActionBar.lua:21-22` regressed.
//!   2. **After populating two forms and calling `StanceBar:Update()`,
//!      `StanceBar.numForms == 2` and both buttons are unchecked.** This is
//!      the test fixture's clean cold state — proves the bar's Update read
//!      `GetNumShapeshiftForms()` (which reads
//!      `state.shapeshift_forms.len()`) and that `UpdateState` ran and
//!      called `SetChecked(false)` on each button (since both forms have
//!      `is_active = false` initially).
//!   3. **After `StanceBar:Select(2)`, `state.shapeshift_forms[1].is_active`
//!      is true and `state.shapeshift_forms[0].is_active` is false.** This
//!      pins the `CastShapeshiftForm` side effect: the indexed form
//!      activated, the other forms cleared. A different reading means
//!      either Select didn't call Cast, Cast had a bug in its toggle/clear
//!      math, or the form index off-by-one regressed.
//!   4. **After Select, `StanceBar.lastSelected == 2`.** Pinned directly by
//!      `Select` at lua:103 before the Cast call. This is the only piece
//!      `Select` writes directly — everything else is downstream of Cast.
//!   5. **After Select, `StanceButton2:GetChecked()` is true and
//!      `StanceButton1:GetChecked()` is false.** This is the round-trip
//!      payoff: `Select` → `Cast` → fires `UPDATE_SHAPESHIFT_FORM` →
//!      controller routes to `StanceBar:Update` → `UpdateState` iterates
//!      and flips the checked state. A false reading on `StanceButton2`
//!      means the controller event dispatch broke (the addon didn't load,
//!      or its OnLoad didn't register the event, or its OnEvent dispatch
//!      regressed). A true reading on `StanceButton1` means
//!      `CastShapeshiftForm` failed to clear non-target forms, or
//!      `UpdateState` skipped the `else` branch at lua:84 that calls
//!      `SetChecked(false)`.
//!
//! Regression candidates the assertions catch:
//!   - `Select` no longer calls `CastShapeshiftForm` (refactor reorders or
//!     drops the call): observation 3 fails (no form activates), 4 still
//!     passes (`lastSelected` is set unconditionally), 5 fails on #2.
//!   - `CastShapeshiftForm` toggle clobbers the indexed form when toggling
//!     off (the cold-state path picks the wrong branch): observation 3
//!     fails inverted (#2 stays inactive).
//!   - `Blizzard_ActionBarController` doesn't load (e.g. dependency
//!     regression): the chain breaks at step 3 (no UPDATE_SHAPESHIFT_FORM
//!     listener), so `StanceBar:Update` never runs after Cast. Observations
//!     3 and 4 still pass, observation 5 fails on #2.
//!   - `UpdateState` short-circuits before the `SetChecked` call (e.g. the
//!     `i <= numForms` gate at lua:66 inverted): observations 3 and 4
//!     still pass, observation 5 fails on #2.
